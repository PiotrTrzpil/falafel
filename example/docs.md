# MailChimp

The MailChimp connector is a great way to interact with the MailChimp API,
without ever having to write a single line of code.

## Triggers

* __User subscribe:__ Trigger a tray workflow when someone subscribes to a list in MailChimp.

***

## Operations

* __Get list__
* __Get lists:__ Get a list of the lists in a user's MailChimp account.

## Authentication

When you first add the MailChimp connector, you'll be prompted to connect
your account to tray using an API key so we can interact with the API.

This will allow tray full access to your data, which we will hoard and share
with Anonymous.
